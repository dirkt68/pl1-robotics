2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u0/pwm_count_reg[6]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u0/pwm_count_reg[0]/CLR, u0/pwm_count_reg[1]/CLR, u0/pwm_count_reg[2]/CLR,
u0/pwm_count_reg[3]/CLR, u0/pwm_count_reg[4]/CLR, u0/pwm_count_reg[5]/CLR
u0/pwm_count_reg[6]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
