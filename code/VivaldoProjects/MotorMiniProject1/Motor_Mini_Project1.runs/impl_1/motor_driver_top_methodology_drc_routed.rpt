2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance u1/dig46.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.585 ns between u1/XLXI_7/inst/DCLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and u1/dig6_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.026 ns between u1/XLXI_7/inst/DCLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and u1/dig6_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
